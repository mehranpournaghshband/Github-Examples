## 🔍 Real-World Example Analysis

**Sample AAPL Analysis Results:**
```
📊 PHASE 1: TREND TEMPLATE
❌ FAIL Price Above SMAs (Price: $211.12 vs 150SMA: $221.32)
❌ FAIL SMA Stacking (50 < 150 < 200 order broken)
❌ FAIL Above 52W Low (24.9% vs needed ≥30%)
✅ PASS Near 52W High (18.6% below high)
✅ PASS Above EMAs (above both 10 & 21 day)

Phase 1 Score: 2/5 ❌ FAIL

📈 PHASE 2: VCP BASE FORMATION
❌ FAIL Contractions not decreasing properly
❌ FAIL Volume not declining during pullbacks
❌ FAIL Price not tightening sufficiently

Phase 2 Score: 0/3 ❌ FAIL

🚀 RECOMMENDATION: 🔴 DO NOT BUY
Risk Management: Stop Loss $191.17 (9.5% risk)
```
